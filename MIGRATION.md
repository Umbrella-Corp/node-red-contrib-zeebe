- **API Compatibility**: All existing Node-RED node functionality remains unchanged

### Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility for Node-RED users:
- All node configurations remain the same
- All input/output message formats are unchanged
- All functionality works identically to the previous version

### Benefits of Migration

- **Security**: Using the official, maintained Camunda 8 SDK
- **Updates**: Will receive ongoing security and feature updates
- **Support**: Official support from Camunda for the SDK
- **Future-proof**: Compatibility with newer Zeebe versions

## Security Updates
While the deprecated package still functions, monitoring for security advisories is crucial. Consider updating to the official SDK when a major version bump is planned.
