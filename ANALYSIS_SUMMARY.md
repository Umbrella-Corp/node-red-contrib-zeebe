5. **message** - Publishes messages to running instances
6. **start-message** - Publishes start messages for new instances
7. **deploy** - Deploys BPMN processes and DMN decisions

## SDK Capabilities Analysis

### 🔍 Available But Unused Capabilities
The Camunda 8 SDK exposes **35+ methods** through multiple API clients:

#### Zeebe gRPC API (Core Process Engine)
- ✅ Currently used: `createProcessInstance`, `createWorker`, `publishMessage`, `publishStartMessage`, `deployResource`
- 🆕 **Available for new nodes**: `cancelProcessInstance`, `setVariables`, `broadcastSignal`, `evaluateDecision`, `createProcessInstanceWithResult`, `resolveIncident`, `topology`, `deleteResource`, `modifyProcessInstance`, `migrateProcessInstance`

#### Additional API Clients (Unused)
- **Operate API** - Process monitoring and querying
- **Tasklist API** - Human task management  
- **Optimize API** - Process analytics
- **Admin API** - User and tenant management
- **Zeebe REST API** - Alternative REST interface
- **Modeler API** - Process model management

## 🎯 Recommended Additional Nodes

### Priority 2: Enhanced Workflow Capabilities (Medium Impact, Medium Complexity)
4. **`evaluate-decision`** - DMN decision evaluation (business rules)
5. **`create-process-instance-with-result`** - Synchronous process execution
6. **`throw-error`** - Business error handling

### Priority 3: Process Monitoring (High Value for Production)
7. **`operate-query`** - Process instance monitoring
8. **`resolve-incident`** - Automated incident resolution
9. **`topology`** - Cluster health monitoring

### Priority 4: Advanced Administration (Specialized Use Cases)
10. **`delete-resource`** - Resource lifecycle management
11. **`tasklist-query`** - Human task integration
12. **`modify-process-instance`** - Advanced process control
