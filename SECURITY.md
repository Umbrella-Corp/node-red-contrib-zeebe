# Security Considerations

## Input Validation

All nodes now include proper input validation to prevent:
- Processing of invalid or malformed payloads
- Injection attacks through unsanitized inputs
- Runtime errors from missing required fields

## Authentication & Authorization

When connecting to Zeebe:
- Always use OAuth authentication in production environments
- Store credentials securely using Node-RED's credential system
- Use TLS/SSL connections when available
- Regularly rotate authentication tokens

## Error Handling

- Error messages are sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed error information is logged securely
- Node status provides user-friendly feedback without exposing sensitive data

## Resource Management

- Workers are properly closed to prevent resource leaks
- Connections are managed efficiently
- Timeouts are configured to prevent hanging connections

## Monitoring & Logging

- All security-relevant events are logged
- Connection status is monitored and reported
- Failed authentication attempts should be tracked

## Best Practices

1. Keep the zeebe-node dependency updated
2. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Implement proper network security between Node-RED and Zeebe
4. Monitor for unusual activity patterns
5. Regular security audits of the deployment

## Vulnerability Management

- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies promptly when security fixes are available
- Subscribe to security advisories for Node-RED and Zeebe
